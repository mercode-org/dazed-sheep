# MerVoxels Server

A Minecraft Classic server written in JavaScript, includes a featureful JavaScript API, complete with world saving. Forked from [dazed-sheep](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/dazed-sheep).

## Test server

* 94.23.58.148:25566 using `start.sh`

You can use [ClassiCube](https://www.classicube.net/) and [MerVoxels](https://voxels.mercode.org/) as a client.

## Plugins
A cool collection of MerVoxels and dazed-sheep plugins, note that some flying-squid plugins may also be compatible!
* [flying-squid-irc](https://github.com/rom1504/flying-squid-irc) an example of a flying-squid plugin that is compatible with MerVoxels out of the box! A bridge between an irc channel and a Minecraft Classic server.

## Building / Running

Before running it is recommended that you configure the server in `config/settings.json`

`build.sh` and `start.sh`
